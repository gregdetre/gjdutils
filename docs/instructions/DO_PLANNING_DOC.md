Do the next stage of the planning doc.

If the planning doc is currently stored in `planning/later/` or `planning/discarded/`, first move it to `planning/` (to signal that it's in progress).

Start by reading relevant code & docs.

Ask if you need to clarify anything, or if you have concerns.

Use tasks and subagents (provided with lots of context), e.g. for curl/Playwright MCP, running tests, and any other encapsulated tasks.
