# Third-Party Library Selection

## Selection Criteria

- **IMPORTANT** Long-lasting community, lots of docs/discussion/examples (so there will be lots of pretraining data to help LLM coding models).
- Well-designed API: Intuitive, composable, type-safe (for TypeScript).
- Plus any other criteria from the user.


## Process
- Understand requirements first. see `SOUNDING_BOARD_MODE.md`. Ask questions if you need to clarify.
- Read relevant code/docs to understand the relevant technology stack & architecture for this project.
- Run `date` to get today's date, so you can judge recency.
- Search the web. Evaluate options, tradeoffs.
- Usually prefer the most recent stable version, but also consider whether an older, more popular version with more pretraining data would be a better fit. Discuss with the user if the answer isn't obvious.
- Make a recommendation.
- Discuss with user.
- Write a doc describing the chosen library, as per `WRITE_DEEP_DIVE_DOC.md`.
