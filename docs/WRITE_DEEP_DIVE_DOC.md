Do a deep dive on the web about the topic that the user has asked about. If you need more clarification about the requirements to focus the search fruitfully, ask questions (ideally upfront). If you need more context from files, investigate for relevant code & docs.

Before you start, run `date` to get today's date, in case you need to assess how recent the search results are.

Then write this up as a detailed reference doc, following the instructions in `docs/WRITING_EVERGREEN_DOCS.md`. Include url links/references (as well as mentions of our own code/docs etc), so we can track down the original sources later if we need to.
